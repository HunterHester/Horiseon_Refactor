# Horiseon Code Refactor
HTML Semantics have been added to make the webpage optimized for SEO as well as for general accessibility.

## Updates
Modified CSS and HTML to hit the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards</li>
<li>WHEN I view the source code</li>
<li>THEN I find semantic HTML elements</li>
<li>WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements</li>
<li>THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</li>
<li>WHEN I view the image elements</li>
<li>THEN I find accessible alt attributes</li>
<li>WHEN I view the heading attributes</li>
<li>THEN they fall in sequential order</li>
<li>WHEN I view the title element</li>
<li>THEN I find a concise, descriptive title</li>
</ul>
